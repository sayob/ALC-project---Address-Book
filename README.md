# ALC-project---Address-Book

This is a simple Address Book that lets you add, edit and delete a contact in the address book.


### Technologies used includes: ###
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Mobile.

## Configuration ##
#### After downloading, ####
__Using Google Chrome(Recommended)__ - make sure to put file in server or simply run code from Visual Studio. 
Reason: I think jQuery Mobile has compatiblity issues with Chrome.

__Using Firefox__ - you can run the index.html file locally but there will be some issues when adding, editing and
deleting contacts.
